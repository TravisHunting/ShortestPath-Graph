# ShortestPath-Graph

An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths.

I implement this using a graph object and node objects which can (obviously) be used to contain any sorts of data.

This could easily be extended to the more common use case (according to Wikipedia) of finding the shortest paths between a source node and all other connected nodes.
